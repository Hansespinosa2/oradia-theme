# VS Code Theme Showcase for Markdown

Welcome to the **Markdown theme test file**. This document includes a **variety of elements** such as headings, lists, code blocks, tables, links, images, blockquotes, and inline formatting to **stress test your VS Code theme**. Each line is intentionally long to **stretch across the editor window and demonstrate syntax highlighting and readability**.

---

## 1. Headings

# H1 - Main Heading
## H2 - Section Heading
### H3 - Subsection Heading
#### H4 - Minor Heading
##### H5 - Small Heading
###### H6 - Tiny Heading

---

## 2. Text Formatting

This text demonstrates **bold**, *italic*, ***bold + italic***, ~~strikethrough~~, and combinations of formatting in a **single long sentence that stretches across the entire editor window to test how VS Code highlights nested Markdown tokens, inline code, and emphasis**.

Inline code example: `const example = "This is a long inline code string to see how your theme colors it";` mixed with **bold** and *italic*.

---

## 3. Lists

### Unordered List
- Item 1: This is a really long list item intended to test wrapping, spacing, and bullet rendering in Markdown across a wide screen in VS Code.
- Item 2: Another long list item with **bold text**, *italic text*, `inline code`, and a [link](https://example.com) all in the same line.
- Item 3: Nested List
  - Subitem 3a: With `inline code` and **bold emphasis** to test nested highlighting.
  - Subitem 3b: Another long string including a URL `https://www.longexampleurl.com/path/to/resource?query=123&other=456` to see syntax coloring.

### Ordered List
1. First item with a long sentence that contains **bold**, *italic*, and `inline code` along with a link to [example.com](https://example.com) to test color highlighting.
2. Second item with more details including multiple `inline code blocks`, numbers like 1234567890, and random text to fill the line length for theme testing.
3. Third item demonstrating nested lists with:
   1. Subitem 1: Including `inline code`, **bold**, *italic*, and URLs.
   2. Subitem 2: Another very long sentence with multiple formatting types to stress test the Markdown syntax highlighting in VS Code.

## 4. Code Blocks

### JavaScript
```javascript
function longExampleFunction(inputArray) {
    return inputArray.map(item => `Processed item: ${item} with index ${inputArray.indexOf(item)} in a very long line to see how syntax highlighting works in your VS Code Markdown theme`).filter(item => item.includes("Processed"));
}
```


This will give you:  
- **Very long lines** to fill the editor horizontally  
- **All major Markdown syntax types**  
- Nested elements and mixed inline formatting  
- Multiple languages inside code blocks  

If you want, I can also make a **super-long “theme stress test Markdown”** with **30–50+ lines** specifically designed to push all theme token types for VS Code.  

Do you want me to do that?
